## Introduction

![model diagram](./img/modelDiagram.png)

<aside class="notes">
In the United States, local decision makers, from school board members to office managers, are being asked to make life and death decisions about when and how to re-open their buildings. Pressure to reopen schools and offices will grow as more and more of the population is vaccinated and these leaders need to be able to make informed decisions.

## The system is complex


>- Processes are non-linear
>- Policies outside your institution impact outcomes in your institution
>- Systems within your institution interact in unexpected ways

<aside class="notes">
These individuals are being asked to reason about a system

## Problem Statement

Assessing risk of SARS-COV-2 infection in indoor spaces is complicated because interactions at multiple spatial and temporal scales influence fine scale disease transmission.


## Graphical User Interface

![Graphical User Interface](./img/guiExample.png)

<aside class="notes">
To make it easier for decision makers to reason about the system, we developed a graphical user interface that allows them to run different scenarios and see the impacts of their choices.

## Simulation Framework

We developed extensible simulation engine accepts modules that modify transmission dynamics. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
DiagrammeR::grViz("
  digraph graph2 {
  
  graph [layout = dot, rankdir = LR]
  
  # node definitions with substituted label text
  node [shape = Square,
        style = filled,
        fixedsize = true,
        width = 1.3]
        
  a [label = 'Graph Object', 
     fillcolor = LightBlue]
  b [label = Model,
     fillcolor = SpringGreen]
  c [label = 'Module 1',
     fillcolor = PaleGoldenrod]
  d [label = 'Module N',
     fillcolor = Plum]
  e [label = 'Simulation\nEngine']
  
  f [label = 'Parameters', 
     fillcolor = Linen]
  
  a->e b->e {c d}->b f->c
  
  }
  ", 
  height = 300)
```


## Extended SIR Model

```{r echo=FALSE}
DiagrammeR::grViz("
  digraph graph2 {
  
  graph [layout = dot, rankdir = LR]
  
  # node definitions with substituted label text
  node [shape = circle,
        style = filled,
        fixedsize = true,
        width = 0.95]
        
  a [label = Susceptible, 
     fillcolor = PaleGreen]
  b [label = Infected,
     fillcolor = Thistle]
  c [label = Removed,
     fillcolor = Gold]
  d [label = Leave,
     shape = s,
     fillcolor = Orange]
  
  node [shape = s,
        style = filled,
        fixedsize = true,
        width = 1.5]   
  
  e [label = 'Direct\nContact',
     fillcolor = LightBlue]
  f [label = 'Environmental\nExposure',
     fillcolor = LightCyan]
  g [label = 'External',
     fillcolor = HoneyDew]

  b->c b->d d->c
  {e f g} -> b
  
  edge [arrowhead = none ]
  a-> {e g f}
    
  
  
  }
  ", 
  height = 300)
```


## Infectiousness Profile

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

infFuncToy <- function(x){
  a <- dgamma(x,shape = 6)
  b <- a/max(a)
}

p <- ggplot(data = data.frame(x = 0), mapping = aes(x = x))

p + 
  stat_function(fun = infFuncToy,size = 2, color = "black")+ 
  xlim(0,20) +
  theme_bw( base_size = 18) +
  xlab("Days Post Infection") +
  ylab("Relative Infectiousness")
  

```

<aside class="notes">

Because we know individuals are not immediately infectious and the amount of virus shed wanes after 5 days post infection, we have generated a relative infectiousness profile. This allows to better reflect the reality of covid transmission. Something that may realize when looking at this plot, is that when you test and remove newly infectious individuals, you are sparing the larger population from being exposed to a highly infectious individual.

## How does transmission happen in our Model?


1) External Transmission
2) Environmental Transmission
3) Direct Contact Transmission

- External infections are derived from a micro markov process model that explicitly incorporates mobility metrics and imported cases

<aside class="notes">
Figure shows case improtations to a focal county, mobility of individuals impacts the probability of infection - line thickness is the number of imported cases, and fill is probability of infection.

## Hierarchy of Controls

![hierarchy of controls](https://aghealth.ucdavis.edu/sites/g/files/dgvnsk261/files/inline-images/Hierarchy%20of%20Controls.jpg)

*Image produced by University of California Davis*


## Hazard Control modules

- **Leave Policy** - removes individuals who tested positive for a number of time steps
- **Room Density Limits** - reduces number of people in a room 
- **Personal Protective Equipment** - reduces the probability of acquiring infection
- **Testing** - does not directly impact transmission but may inform other policies (e.g. leave)


## Vaccination

- Protects from severe disease
- May not prevent transmission

- External Transmission
- Environmental Transmission
- Direct Contact Transmission
- Transmission Modifiers


##  Environmental Infections Equations

- *Emission Rate*
$$ {ER_{q,j} = c_v*c_i*IR*\sum_{i=1}^4(N_{i,j}*V_i)} $$

- *Viral Concentration in Room*
$$ {n(t) = \frac{ER_q*I}{IVRR*V}+(n_o+\frac{ER_q*I}{IVRR})*\frac{e^{IVRR*t}}{V}} $$

- *Risk of Infection*
$$ {R_{env} = 1-e^{-IR\int_0^Tn(t)dt}} $$
