## Introduction

![model diagram](./img/modelDiagram.png)

<aside class="notes">
In the United States, local decision makers, from school board members to office managers, are being asked to make life and death decisions about when and how to re-open their buildings. Pressure to reopen schools and offices will grow as more and more of the population is vaccinated and these leaders need to be able to make informed decisions.

## The system is complex


>- Processes are non-linear
>- Policies outside your institution impact outcomes in your institution
>- Systems within your institution interact in unexpected ways

## SARS-COV-2 Transmission

- Presence of infectious individuals or materials
- Inhalation of infectious particles 
- Introduction of fomites to mucus membranes

## Hazard Controls

## Vaccination

- Protects from severe disease
- May not prevent transmission

## Problem Statement

Assessing risk of SARS-COV-2 infection in indoor spaces is complicated because interactions at multiple spatial and temporal scales influence fine scale disease transmission.

## Simulation Framework

An extensible simulation engine accepts modules that modify transmission dynamics.

## Model layers

- External Transmission
- Spatial Transmission
- Direct Contact Transmission

## Estimating external infections

[get explanation from trevor]

- Probability of infection estimated from a micro mcmc model - work was presented early today by Trevor Kent and Heather Pastolic.

- Uses case counts back estimated from deaths and mobility data derived from cell phone data to determine the probability of infection in a given location. 

- We use that probability of infection to generate external infections while simulants are outside of their office space.
