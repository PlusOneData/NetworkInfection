## Intro

![model diagram](./img/modelDiagram.png)

## SARS-COV-2 Transmission

- Inhalation of infectious particles 
- Introduction of fomites to mucus membranes
- Presence of infectious particles and fomites 


## Hazard Controls

## Problem Statement

Assessing risk of SARS-COV-2 infection in indoor spaces is complicated because interactions at multiple spatial and temporal scales influence fine scale disease transmission.

## Simulation Framework

An extensible simulation engine accepts modules that modify transmission dynamics.

- External Transmission
- Spatial Transmission
- Direct Contact Transmission

## Estimating external infections

[get explanation from trevor]

- Probability of infection estimated from a micro mcmc model - work was presented early today by Trevor Kent and Heather Pastolic.

- Uses case counts back estimated from deaths and mobility data derived from cell phone data to determine the probability of infection in a given location. 

- We use that probability of infection to generate external infections while simulants are outside of their office space.
