# Cohort Control Model
# Goals: Govern how cohorting affects nodes
# ---- daily components
# Shift length - how many days in a row will a cohort occupy the office 
# ---- hour components
# Shift length - how many hours is each shift
# Frequency - instances per week shifts occur 
# buffer - avoid having sessions on the same day
# mitigation_buffer - time between shifts that allows for virus to be removed
# ---- additional items
# groups per shift 
# understand which groups can be in the office together without increasing
# contacts

#' Cohort Control Class
#'
#' A default class to control cohort actions.
#' A graph of n nodes with a \code{$cohort} property. 
#' 
#' When \code{$donext} is called 1 is added to the \code{$leaveCounter} property and 
#' infection status evaluated.
#' If \code{$reported} is false and \code{$leaveCounter} equal to or
#' greater than \code{leaveDuration} and \code{$infected} is 2, 
#' the \code{$infect} attribute is set to 2 or "recovered". 
#'
#' @field shift_length Number time steps a cohort is in the office
