\title{Density Infection Class}
\description{
A default class to implement spreading an infection from initial nodes based on
infection density.
An \code{init_num} of nodes have their \code{$infected} property set to T.
When \code{$donext} the probability of infection is calculated using the sum of
adjacent infected nodes times the probability of infection.
