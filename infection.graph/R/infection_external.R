#' Infection External Class
#'
#' An additional class to implement spreading an infection from external factors
#' or outside of the office. We initialize the graph with the existing nodes.
#' When \code{$donext} is called a random number of nodes will be infected based
#' the external infection \code{rate}.
#'
#' @field rate Probability an adjacent node will become infected
#' @export external_infect
