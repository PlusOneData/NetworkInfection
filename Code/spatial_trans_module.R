#' Spatial transmission Module
#'
#' At the start of each day it is assumed all rooms are not contaminated. Rooms are contaminated at
#' a given rate and decontaminated at a given rate. Individuals can be infected after spending
#' a certain amount of time in a room with a certain level of contamination.
#'
#' @field rooms Dataframe of rooms with name and volume attributes
#' @field infConc Numeric, concentration where room becomes infectious
#' @field conRate Numeric, rate of contamination by infectious individuals
#' @field deconRate Numeric, rate of decontamination (may move to room attribute)
#' @field envTransRate Numeric, transmission rate for environmental contamination (0 to 1)
