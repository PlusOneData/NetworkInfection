# Testing module
# Goals: ability to establish different testing regimes on contact network.
# ---- basic components
# testing frequency
# testing results delay
# ---- additional items
# test sensitivity
# test specificity
# false positive rate
# false negative rate
# sampling size


#' Testing Class
#'
#' A default class to implement testing on nodes.
#' A graph of n nodes with an \code{$infected} property have their \code{$detected} property set to T or F. 
#' When \code{$donext} is called 1 is added to the \code{$outbreakDay} property and 
#' 1 is added to the \code{$testCounter} property if a an infection was previously detected.
#' If \code{$testCounter} is equal to or greater than \code{testDelay} and \code{$detected} is TRUE, 
#' the \code{$reported} attribute is set to T. 
#'
#' @field testDelay Number time steps after test day to test results
#' @field testFrequency Number time steps between testing
#' @field falseNegRate frequency that a person with covid tests negative
#' @field falsePosRate frequency that a person without covid tests positive
#' @field propTested Proportion of people tested for covid
#' @export default_testing
