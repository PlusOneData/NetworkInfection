#' Density Infection Class
#'
#' A default class to implement spreading an infection from initial nodes based on
#' infection density.
#' An \code{init_num} of nodes have their \code{$infected} property set to T.
#' When \code{$donext} the probability of infection is calculated using the sum of
#' adjacent infected nodes times the probability of infection.
#'
#' @field init_num Number of initial infected nodes
#' @field transRate Probability of infection given contact
#' @export density_infect
